# Good Practices and Criteria for Research Software Development

This file contains a list of criteria and good practices for research software development. They are categorized into different areas to provide a structured approach to developing high-quality research software. Each criterion is accompanied by a focus, timing, and a further explanation.

- **Reuse and extend other software**  
  - _Focus_: Software Design
  - _Timing_: Before development
  - _Further explanation_: This includes not researching and reusing existing software, but also extending it to meet specific needs.

- **Organize yourself and your team**  
  - _Focus_: Meta
  - _Timing_: Before, during and after development
  - _Further explanation_: Create appropriate processes and tools for collaboration and communication.

- **Consider reuse of your software**  
  - _Focus_: Software Design
  - _Timing_: Before, during and after development
  - _Further explanation_: Make your software reusable and extensible.

- **Design simple software**  
  - _Focus_: Software Design
  - _Timing_: Before, during and after development
  - _Further explanation_: Keep your software simple and easy to understand.

- **Use version control**  
  - _Focus_: Software Development
  - _Timing_: During development


- **Develop open source**  
  - _Status_: May be implicitly fulfilled. Important to address the reasons for open-source development.

- **Test your software**  
  - _Focus_: Testing
  - _Timing_: During and after development

- **Document your code**  
  - _Focus_: Documentation
  - _Timing_: During and after development
  - _Further explanation_: Includes various types of documentation, such as code docstrings, manuals, and potentially a software-focused publication.

- **Make your code findable**  
  - _Focus_: Meta
  - _Timing_: During and after development
  - _Further explanation_: (e.g., make the repository known in community spaces, use appropriate keywords, maintain a well-written README, apply some SEO practices, integrate with community platforms).

- **Include research software engineering in your project proposals**  
  - _Focus_: Meta
  - _Timing_: Well before repository development.

- **Grow your software**  
  - _Focus_: Maintenance
  - _Timing_: After the development.

- **Regularly exchange with other developers**  
  - _Focus_: Meta
  - _Timing_: Regularly, before, during and after development.
