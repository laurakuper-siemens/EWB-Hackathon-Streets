# `assets` Directory

This folder contains all non-code assets used throughout the project, such as images, icons, fonts, and other media files. Organizing assets here keeps the repository structure clean and helps maintain consistency across the application.

## Folder Structure

The `assets` directory is organized to make it easy to locate and update assets as needed. Below is the recommended structure:
```bash
assets/
├── images/
│   ├── logos/                # Project and company logos
│   ├── screenshots/         # Screenshots used in the README, documentation, or for reference purposes
│   ├── icons/               # Icons for UI components, commonly used within the project
├── fonts/                   # Custom fonts used in the project
├── media/                   # Media files such as audio and video
│   ├── audio/               # Audio files used within the project
│   ├── video/               # Video files used within the project
```

### Subfolder Descriptions

- **`images/`**: Contains image files, divided into subfolders for logos, screenshots, and icons to keep visuals organized.
  - **`logo/`**: Stores the primary project or company logos in various formats and sizes.
  - **`screenshots/`**: Includes screenshots used in the README, documentation, or for reference purposes.
  - **`icons/`**: Holds smaller images like icons for UI components, commonly used within the project.

- **`fonts/`**: Holds any custom font files used in the project. Add the fonts here and update your CSS or frontend settings to import them accordingly.

- **`media/`**: Stores audio, video, or animations needed for the project.
  - **`audio/`**: For sound files used within the project.
  - **`video/`**: For any video content, such as tutorial videos, animations, or background media.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for files. For example, `logo-primary.png` or `icon-add-user.svg` to quickly identify asset type and purpose.
2. **File Formats**:
   - **Images**: Use `SVG` for icons and logos where possible to ensure scalability. For larger images or screenshots, `PNG` and `JPEG` formats are preferred.
   - **Fonts**: Include web-safe formats like `WOFF` and `WOFF2`.
   - **Audio/Video**: Use `MP3` for audio and `MP4` for video for compatibility.
3. **Optimization**: Optimize assets before uploading to reduce file size and improve loading times. For example, compress images and audio files to ensure the application runs efficiently.
4. **Referencing Assets**: When referencing assets in your code, maintain relative paths to this directory. This ensures links remain valid if the repository is cloned or moved.

## Contributing to `assets`

- **Adding New Assets**: Place new assets in the appropriate subfolder. If the asset doesn’t fit the existing structure, consider creating a new subfolder.
- **Updating Assets**: If you need to update an existing asset (e.g., a logo), replace the file while keeping the original name to avoid breaking links in the codebase.
- **Removing Assets**: If an asset is no longer needed, confirm that it is not referenced elsewhere in the project before deletion.
