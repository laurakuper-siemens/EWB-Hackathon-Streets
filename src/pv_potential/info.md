# PV Potential

In this task, we will calculate the potential of photovoltaic (PV) systems for different building types (or take the existing data). Exemplary data is available for Berlin in `data/processed/Berlin`. The result should be compared against the Markstammdatenregister, to figure out if there is already a PV system installled.
