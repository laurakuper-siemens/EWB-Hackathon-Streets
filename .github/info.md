### Issue Templates

The `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory contains templates that guide contributors in creating consistent and detailed issue reports. Each template is tailored for specific types of issues, helping to streamline issue management.

#### Available Issue Templates:
- **Bug Report**: Use this template to report any issues with existing functionality. It includes fields for steps to reproduce, expected and actual results, and relevant screenshots.
- **Feature Request**: This template is for proposing new features or enhancements. It asks for a detailed description of the feature, any potential use cases, and an explanation of the impact.
- **Data Addition/Modification**: Designed for cases where contributors need to add or update data in the system. This template includes fields for specifying the data source, details of the modification, and the intended effect.

Contributors can select these templates when opening a new issue, which ensures that each report contains the necessary information to be actionable.

### Workflow Files

Our GitHub workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/` and use GitHub Actions to automate various parts of the development lifecycle. 

#### Key Workflows:
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automatically runs tests and builds the project for every pull request to the main branch, ensuring that changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Linting and Code Quality Checks**: This workflow runs linting and style checks on every push to enforce coding standards and maintain code quality.
- **Deployment Workflow** (if applicable): This workflow handles automatic deployment to the staging or production environment after a successful merge to the main branch.

Each workflow is triggered by specific events (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`) and provides feedback to contributors directly on GitHub.

### Contribution Guidelines

For more detailed information on contributing to this repository, refer to our main `CONTRIBUTING.md` file located in the root directory. This file outlines:
- Code style requirements
- Pull request process
- Branching strategies
- Testing requirements

### How to Use

1. **Creating Issues**: When creating an issue, select the template that best matches the type of issue youâ€™re reporting. Fill out all relevant fields to help the maintainers understand and prioritize your report.
  
2. **Working with Workflows**: GitHub workflows are automatically triggered based on specific events, so contributors generally do not need to interact with them directly. However, contributors can view the status and logs of workflows from the GitHub Actions tab to troubleshoot any errors or issues during CI/CD.

3. **Maintainers**: Maintainers can modify or add new templates and workflows as needed. For example, you may add a new issue template for documentation requests or create a custom workflow for testing specific parts of the application.
